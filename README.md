# DSCENet
We propose a Dynamic Screening and Clinical-Enhanced Network (DSCENet) for the subtype classification of MPNs on the multimodal fusion of whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical information. 

We have uploaded part of the code, in which the core model is located in Model.DSCE
from Models.model_DSCE import DSCE 

Our code is currently undergoing generalizability testing. Stay tuned.
